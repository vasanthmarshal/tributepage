    <h2 class="side">About</h2>
    Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, on 28 December 1937,
    and is the son of Naval Tata (born in Surat).
    His biological maternal grandmother had been the sister of Hirabai Tata,
    wife of group founder Jamshedji Tata. His biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata
    had belonged to the broader Tata family; Ratan therefore was a Tata by birth.
    Parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when Ratan was 10,
    and he was subsequently raised by the widow of Sir Ratanji Tata,
    his grandmother, Navajbai Tata, who formally adopted him through the J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage.
    He has a half-brother, Noel Tata (from Naval Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata),
    with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati. </div>

        <h2 class="side">Achievements</h2>
        <br>
        The 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit,
        over 50 times. Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over,
        the majority sales came from brands when he exited. He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley,
        Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus.
        All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business,
        with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.
        He conceptualised the Tata Nano car. In 2015, He explained in an interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating
        Emerging Markets project,
        the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average
        Indian consumer
